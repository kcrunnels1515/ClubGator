# HobbyGator
## A Forum-Based Hobby Website
For the hobby-enthusiast or currently hobby-less who would like to share the love of their hobbies as well as learn about hobbies they have never delved into, HobbyGator allows cultivation of community through sharing and introduction of hobbies. Unlike previous social media, HobbyGator doesnâ€™t rely on follower counts or fame for a user to still partake in conversations with well-versed hobbyists; by allowing chats with any and everyone, users can have a diverse hobby-centric experience centered around growing.
